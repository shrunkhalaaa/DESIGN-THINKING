# DESIGNTHINKING

Let's learn what is design thinking ad how to approach this.

It s a way to approach a problem by gathering information and way to question your possible client to identify the root causes of a problem or where the actual problem is happening.
OR, Design thinking is an iterative process in which you seek to understand your users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions which you can prototype and test.

This enables us as data scientists to:
- Figure out what is the real problem we are trying to solve
- Understand if we even need a model
- Make sure what is in our stakeholderâ€™s head is what we are going to provide
- Know how the model will impact the users/business

Rather than accept the problem as given, designers explore the given problem and its context and may re-interpret or restructure the given problem in order to reach a particular framing of the problem that suggests a route to a solution.

And for this many frameworks are used, the popular frameworks are:
- 5W's and 1H Framwork(general problem)
- 5WHY's Framework()
- SPIN selling Framework(B-B, B-C, WHEN YOU NEED TO SALE PRODUCT) [SITUATION, PROBLEM, IMPLICATION, NEED PAYOFF]
- Issue tree Framework(Finding the root cause) [[PROBLEM--> ISSUE1
                                                           ISSUE2
                                                           ISSUE3]]
- 7P's Framework(Marketing problem, marketing campaigns to attract or approach customers) [PRODUCT, PRICE, PLACE, PROMOTION, PEOPLE, PROCESS, PHYSICAL EVIDENCE]
